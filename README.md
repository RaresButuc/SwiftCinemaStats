### Technologies Used

During SwiftCinemaStats' development, several important technologies were used:

- JavaScript with React: Leveraged for frontend development, JavaScript empowered the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces. React, a powerful library, facilitated the construction of engaging UI components, enhancing the user experience;

- Express.js: Serving as the backend framework, Express.js streamlined the development of robust APIs, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend and database;

- MongoDB: As the primary database system, MongoDB efficiently managed data storage and retrieval, offering flexibility in handling diverse data formats and scaling as needed;

- Postman: Instrumental in API testing and validation, Postman ensured the reliability and functionality of the APIs, guaranteeing seamless interactions between different components;

### Challenges

The most important challenges we encountered during the development:

- Styling using CSS instead of Bootstrap(that we didn't knew at the time of development);

- Canceling some plans for the website becuase the API doesn't work as we expected;

  ### Future Plans
  
Our future plans for the "SwiftCinemaStats" platform include:

- Rewriting the design in Bootstrap for much more flexibility;

- Finding more APIs to add more functionalities for the website such as showing more options for the title of the movie searched;
